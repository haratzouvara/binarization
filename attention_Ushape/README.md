## Document Image Binarization using a Deep Learning Neural Network

Tensorflow implementation of U-shape architecture based on U-net architecture. 
The model includes an attention mechanism inspirited by 'CBAM' attention mechanism

There is also the ability to use the 'SAGAN' self-attention mechanism or not to use one.

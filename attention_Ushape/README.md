Tensorflow implementation of U-shape architecture based on U-net architecture. 
In the model can be included an attention mechanism.

There is the ability for usage of an mechanism based on 'CBAM' attention module
or to use a self-attention mechanism based on 'SAGAN'.







The framework can be utilised in document image segmentation task.
